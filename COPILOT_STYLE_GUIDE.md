# GitHub Copilot Style Instructions

Always follow these rules when generating or editing code for this project:

- Use the same styling conventions as the rest of the app.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all layout, color, and spacing.
- Use dark backgrounds (bg-black, bg-black/80) and white text (text-white) for main containers.
- Use rounded corners (rounded, rounded-lg), borders (border, border-white), and drop shadows (shadow, shadow-lg) for containers.
- Use consistent padding (p-2, p-4, p-6, p-8) and margin (m-2, m-4, m-8, mt-8, mb-6, etc.).
- Use the same font and color scheme as the rest of the app.
- Use flex and grid utilities for layout, centering, and alignment.
- Use the same button and input styles as seen in other pages (e.g., bg-white text-black rounded hover:bg-gray-200).
- Always match the look and feel of existing pages, especially login, profile, and frontpage.
- Never introduce new styling conventions or CSS unless explicitly instructed.
- If unsure, copy the style from existing pages/components.

These rules must be followed for all new features, pages, and components.
