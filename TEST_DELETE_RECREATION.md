# Test Plan: Delete and Recreation Functionality

## Test Scenario
Testing that deleted conversations can be properly recreated when users click "Message" button from search page.

## Expected Behavior
1. **Delete Conversation**: User deletes a direct message conversation
2. **Conversation Disappears**: Conversation is removed from chat list and doesn't reappear
3. **Search Page Navigation**: User goes to search page, finds the user, clicks "Message"
4. **Recreation Success**: New conversation is created and user can send messages
5. **Persistent Recreation**: Deleted status is cleared and conversation works normally

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **Search Page Alert**: Removed alert that prevented recreation
2. ✅ **UnifiedMessages URL Handling**: Updated to allow recreation from search page
3. ✅ **New DM Modal**: Removed filtering that hid previously deleted users
4. ✅ **localStorage Sync**: Search page now removes users from deleted list
5. ✅ **State Management**: UnifiedMessages syncs with localStorage changes

## Test Steps
1. Start a conversation with a user
2. Delete the conversation using context menu
3. Verify conversation disappears from list
4. Go to search page (/search)
5. Find the same user
6. Click "Message" button
7. Verify new conversation opens in chat page
8. Send a message to confirm functionality
9. Verify conversation persists after page refresh

## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All fixes implemented and ready for testing
