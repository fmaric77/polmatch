Speak the truth, be honest, answer as many questions as you see fit for the most accurate search results and avoid compromising your identity, if you care. The more questions you answer the better your chances for a proper match. If you decide to lie, it will backfire with time, in your relationship, with anyone who takes your answers as the truth.
Please NOTE! "The absence of an answer is an answer as well" & Lying makes you a liar which will back fire in the long run., so don't do it, do not waste your own and other people's time.
