# Reply Threading Real-Time Fix Summary

## Problem
Reply threads were only visible after page reload, not in real-time when messages were sent. This was because the SSE (Server-Sent Events) notification system wasn't including `reply_to` data in real-time message updates.

## Root Cause
1. The `NewMessageData` interface in `components/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` was missing the `reply_to` field
2. SSE notification calls in API routes weren't passing `reply_to` data
3. SSE message handlers in components weren't processing `reply_to` data

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Interfaces
- **`components/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`**: Added `reply_to?` field to `NewMessageData` interface
- **`lib/sse-notifications.ts`**: Added `reply_to?` field to `GroupMessageData` interface  
- **`components/UnifiedMessagesRefactored.tsx`**: Added `reply_to?` field to `GroupMessageSSE` interface
- **`components/hooks/useProfileMessaging.ts`**: Added `reply_to?` field to `ProfileMessage` interface
- **`components/hooks/useProfileMessages.ts`**: Added `reply_to?` field to `ProfileMessage` interface
- **`components/hooks/useMessages.ts`**: Added `reply_to?` field to `PrivateMessage` interface

### 2. Updated API Notification Calls
- **`app/api/messages/route.ts`**: Already had `...(reply_to && { reply_to })` spread operator
- **`app/api/friends/profile/messages/route.ts`**: Added `...(reply_to && { reply_to })` to `notifyNewMessage` call
- **`app/api/groups/[id]/channels/[channelId]/messages/route.ts`**: Added `...(reply_to && { reply_to })` to `notifyNewGroupMessage` call

### 3. Updated SSE Message Handlers
- **`components/Messages.tsx`**: Added `...(data.reply_to && { reply_to: data.reply_to })` to new message creation
- **`components/UnifiedMessagesRefactored.tsx`**: Added `...(data.reply_to && { reply_to: data.reply_to })` to:
  - Profile message handler
  - Regular message handler  
  - Group message handler

### 4. Updated SSE Data Creation
- **`lib/sse-notifications.ts`**: Added `...(data.reply_to && { reply_to: data.reply_to })` to group message SSE data

## Result
Reply threads now display immediately in real-time when messages are sent, without requiring a page reload. The fix covers:
- Direct messages (both profile-specific and regular)
- Group messages (all profile types)
- Channel messages (all profile types)

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open two browser windows/tabs with different users
2. Start a conversation and send a message
3. Reply to that message from either user
4. Verify the reply thread appears immediately in both windows without reload
5. Test across different profile types (basic, love, business)
6. Test in both direct messages and group channels
